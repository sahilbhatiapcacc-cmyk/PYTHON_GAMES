this notes.txt is for notes for python cource

CONDITOINAL OPERATOROR
"X" if condition else "Y"

LENGTH FUNCTION
len(variablename) -> gives you number of charcters in it

FIND METHOD FOR FIRST OCCURANCE
variablename.find("finding element")

FIND METHOD FOR LAST OCCURANCE 
variablename.rfind("finding element")

CAPATALIZE METHOD
variablename.capatalize() -> leaving the barcket empty
this will capatalize the first letter

UPPER()
this helps is upperccasing the whole text(variablename.upper())

LOWER()
this helps is lowercasing the whole text(varaibelname.lower())

ISDIGIT()
this will return TRUE if and only if the variable name inside the isdigit() is digits

ISALPHA()
this will give TRUE if only alphabets are there in the variable_name(space " " is not trated as string in isalpha() )

COUNT()
this is used to count specific cccharaccter in the string and gives you the number of charcter in that strings
example= variable_name.count("0")

REPLACE() METHOD
used to replace any charcter with another inside the string
example= variable_name.replace("-"," ")



STRING INDEXING
indexing synatx is ->
variable_name[start:end:stop]
indexing always strat from 0
and goes till (end-1) 

last indexing goes form ->
-1(end-most charcter) and -4(fourth last charcter)

to reverse the number ->
variable_name=varaibel_name[::-1] 


FORMAT SPECIFIERS
used as {value:flags} ->
{price:.2f} -> for two point decimal value


WHILE LOOP


FOR LOOP
for counter in range(start,stop,step):
    print("whatever")

for is used when we know the noumber of iteration before hand 
for goes form start to stop-1 having step of step

unique use of for loop ->
for counter in y:
    print("whatever")
#and y being a series of character


BREAK AND CONTINUE

same as c langauge 

TIME LIBRARY(import time)
time.sleep(no. of seconds) ->
this will sleep the execution for the number of seconds 

DIFFERENT TYPES OF COLLECTIONS ->
COLLECTIONS -> a single variable used for storing multiple values

L_I_S_T ->

lst =["one","two","three"]
lst[0]
lst.append("five")
lst.insert(index_number,"number")
lst.remove("element name")
lst.sort() -> willl sort the list in order
lst.reverse() -> will reverse the order in according to the order which we initialized 

lst.clear() -> this will clear all the elements form the list
lst.index("element name") -> this will give the index of that element
lst.count(element name) -> thisb will give the number of count of the presence of that element

"elementname" in lst -> this will give boolean value true/false

len(lst) -> this will give the length of the comma seperated elements in the list



S_E_T ->

set is unordered and immutable so INDEXING wont work in set [NO DUPLICATES ARE ALLOWED]

st={"one","two","three"} -> OK
st = {"one","two","one"}  -> NOT OK (duplicate not allowed)
we can only add/remove not chage the element name

st.add("element name") -> we use .add because print(st) will give random order of elements everytime
st.remove("elementname") -> remove that element and give the set in random order 
st.pop() -> this will delete a random element from the set{}
print(element_name in set/tuple/list name)

T_U_P_L_E() ->  uses round bracket to represent TUPLE
tuple() is way more faster than list 
duplicate within tuple is considered 
so, we can use ->
tuplename.count("element name")


D_I_C_T_I_O_N_A_R_I_E_S{}

dictionaries uses {key:value} -> pair 

.get() -> method is used to to gather the value for that key
student.get("sahil") -> will return value assiciated with it
studnet.get(koibhi) -> will return "none" if it does not have the key written in get()

.update() method is used to update/add a new key-value pair 
if the key in the update() is not in the dictionary then a new key:value pair will be added

.popitem() -> will delete the latest key:value pair
.pop("key") -> will delete the the key:value
.clear() -> will clear the dictionay with no key:value remaining

to get key and values in dictionaries seperately ->
.keys() -> will give all keys
.values() -> will give all the values 

student.items() -> will give the 2-D list of tupels -> [("sahil",7),(...),(...)]


we can ->

for key,value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}:{value}")

this will print the key:value pair in the proper format.


R_A_N_D_O_M-M_O_D_U_L_E

import random
random.randint(low,high)

random.random() -> this will give a random floating point number between 0 and 1.
random.random() -> this method takes no arguments.

.choice() method -> it is used to choose from the sequence
random.choice(options) -> where options is defined by the user

.shuffle() method -> it is used to shuffle the sequence 
random.shuffle("sequence variable") -> after printing it will give jumbeled sequence


FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON

we use function so that we can reuse a block of code multiple times in the code.
we use def() to make functions in python

def function_name(): and then all the content of function will be with an indentation

for example ->

def happy_birthday():
    print("happy")
    print("birthday")
    print("to you")

functions has ARGUMENTS also ->

def happy_birthday(name):
    print(f"happy birthday to {name}")

we can also use ---return--- ->
def add(x,y):
    z=x+Y
    return z

now we can use ->
print(add(3,6)) -> output will give these parameters to the function's argument and return its addition.

DEFUALT ARGUMENTS ->
1.POSITIONAL
2.DEFUALT
3.KEYWORD
4.ARBITRARY

def sales(1st argument,2nd argument=7,3rd argument=0.98765):
    .
    .
    .

print(sales(500)) -> we ccan only give one or as many parameters as we want by using deafult arguments .
we have assigned 2nd argument and 3rd argument to zero(or any other value , that will remain cconstant throughout the function)

for example ->

import time
def countertime(end ,start=0):      # we have to place the default argument after the non-deafult arguemnt.
    for x in range(start,end+1):
        print(x)
        time.sleep(1)
    print("done!!")
countertime(0,10)

but, what if we want to start with 0 all the time. 
here , we can default argument.
